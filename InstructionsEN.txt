Colambful; v0.92b (english)

It's probably more fun with four or more players (though you -can- play with just one friend).

---KEYS---
Directional arrows to move,
Left Ctrl to change your own colour,
Spacebar to change others' colour (you have to be near them, and look directly at them; there is a 0.5 second cooldown)
In the sub-menu after everyone is connected, Spacebar to say you're ready (the game starts when everyone is ready)
After you've died, Spacebar to change which player you're watching.
Escape to toggle the connection information on and off.

---RULES---
Each player has a limited number of colour changes. When they're all used up, they die.
Mice make you change colour on contact.
If you stay on top of the same colour for too long (more than 20 seconds), your colour changes.
When you change your own colour, it only counts as half a colour change.
The round icon in the top right corner shows the player's remaining lives.
Just after you changed color, you get a color boost.

--CONNEXION--
You can play over the Internet:
	host: Play>Enable MatchMaker>Create Internet Match (you can change the name of your match in the box just below written 'default')
	guests: Play> Find Internet Match > Join Match: default (unless the host changed the name, in which case it'll be Join Match: ChosenName)
Or through LAN:
	host: Play> Initialize Broadcast> Start Broadcasting ; LAN Host(H)
	guests: Play> Initialize Broadcast> Listen for Broadcast; put the IP address of the host (the broadcast gave it to you; it looks like 192.168.x.xx) in the field written 'localhost', then LAN Client(C)

--FEATURES--
You can change the default keys, the computer will remember.
You can change the default colours, but the computer won't remember.

--KNOWN BUGS--
If you play through Wine, depending on your distro it may not display the menus' texts (if it indeed does not, you can use the Colambful_menuOptionsForWineUsers folder's images to help you navigate, but it may not be up-to-date)
