todoes multi

currently working on: 
	camera follow not-dead players
	multi?
	scores (name. then stats)

to implement:
--DONE-- anim sheep death
--DONE-- anim sheep death same col as sheep
2	when dead follow other players
		mon colorManager qui est un gameManager pourrait au d�but du jeu enregistrer le joueur et si le joueur n'est plus l� lancer le "follow other players"
4	custom colors depending on the day (christmas, gay pride, halloween...) (colourblind option)
3	custom colours dans le menu
4	custom number of colours? hard to level design - except if each map has a number of colours - and they only show if the right number of colours is set; colours sheep < map: areas where they'd rather not go (interesting if those are corridors); colours sheep > map: random change col sucks for player (good? bad?)
2	custom key bindings (global or local? Maybe all boring settings are local. They should.)
2	(boring options menu in-game)
3	custom musics
4	sound volume
4	custom EVERYTHING
2	more lvls
1	teeeeeeams! (how many) (divide total players by teams, substract; divide rest total numbers by rest teams, substract; etc. )
2	team share lives (both have to be ok with it, and they change col painlessly while doing it)
	max number of players (lobby) - min number of players?
2	max time (needs: scores)
2	deathwave (how often) (et donne une couleur: s'ils sont pas sur cette couleur ils meurent)
	leur demander leur nom (lobby)
1	score screen (time of death, colour changes to others, colour changes from others, self colour changes, mice inflicted-colour changes, number of kills?) (faire une classe score qui chope automatiquement les noms des joueurs)
3	different game modes? (no idea which though, except for deathwave/teams/chrono); actually, having preset options: attrition war (lots of life), thunderstorm (little life, frequent deathwaves, teams), chacun pour soi, teams of two, two sides, protect the Thingie (nope, no clue how that'd work)
--DONE-- cooldown?
999	make a lvl editor :D
--DONE-- gerer pos camera so it doesn't fish eye so much
4	language choice
	players in a list when join? So the game knows when you've won or something? or for easier reboot? Or something?
2	esc -> sure wanna quit? Yes -> back to lobby (lobby)
4	add a "rotating right/left without advancing" anim?
2	tuto: a solo scene filled with npc sheep and a few mice where everything that happens is commented and you can see exactly how many lives the npc sheep (and you) have left; 
	less default mice
4	have the lobby start not automatically but when the host clicks okay (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetLobby.html "All of the above server functions have empty default implementations, except for OnLobbyServerPlayersReady, which calls ServerChangeScene with the PlayScene.")
	speed boost after a color change
	wine issue: no words (at the very least include screenshots for linux users)
	

bugs:
--DONE-- client only on second time
--DONE-- rat anim ugly (check how sheep synchronises and do the same)
--DONE: faster rotation speed-- have rat LOOK WHERE THEY'RE GOING (don't drink and drive)
	playing with outside players doesn't work :( (unity matchmaking) (lobby) -- no clue why, it works when I test on my computer; I need two computers and two networks; maybe first try LAN with two diff computers actually -- test global multi, too, now that I've set it up to work through the unity servers -- nope doesn't work either; see there in the comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9kzrLkF10
I think you can already play over the Internet. I dont have time to test it since my game is buggy at the moment. But if you look at the "lobby manager" script you will see the "network info", expand this and you will see the port number. in my case is 7777 by default. So theoretically if you forward this port on you router settings, will make your server accessible  over the Internet. Now, to join the server over the Internet, Go to play mode and on the "join a game" section replace the local IP (127.0.0.1) with your external IP.  And hopefully you can play with your friends.﻿
use your ip address and forward ports on your router to play over the internet﻿

or scrap the lobby and use evolve?
check how the not-lobby matchmaking works (more like: whether)

-- huh yes they do?-- client's camera don't follow them
--DONE-- anim sheep death: plays anim twice on first time (afterwards, only once like they should). Why?
	needs wider lookat radius for attackChangeCOl -- ask flo, she'll know
--DONE-- fix mice's lvlSize array
	check if attackChangeCol works as intended
	sometimes sheep death anim only works on localPlayer (probs because the server is told of the collision at some random point after it happens and if it is after the anim has finished playing then it skips the anim)
--DONE: more like lobby manager fixed it all on its own-- can't play twice in a row (check if it persists with the lobby manager)
--DONE-- enemy spawns at center. enemySpawner script seems fine though
--DONE-- make prettier code for the thing bastien helped with
