todoes multi

to implement:
--DONE-- anim sheep death
	when dead follow other players
	tuto: a solo scene filled with npc sheep and a few mice where everything that happens is commented and you can see exactly how many lives the npc sheep (and you) have left
	have the lobby start not automatically but when the host clicks okay (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetLobby.html "All of the above server functions have empty default implementations, except for OnLobbyServerPlayersReady, which calls ServerChangeScene with the PlayScene.")

bugs:
	client only on second time
	rat anim ugly (check how sheep synchronises and do the same)
--DONE: faster rotation speed-- have rat LOOK WHERE THEY'RE GOING (don't drink and drive)
	play with outside players (unity matchmaking)
-- huh yes they do?-- client's camera don't follow them
--DONE-- anim sheep death: plays anim twice on first time (afterwards, only once like they should). Why?
