todoes multi

to implement:
--DONE-- anim sheep death
	when dead follow other players
	custom colors depending on the day (christmas, gay pride, halloween...) (colourblind option)
	custom colours dans le menu
	custom keys (global or local? Maybe all boring settings are local. They should.)
	custom musics
	sound volume (global or local?)
	custom EVERYTHING

bugs:
	client only on second time
	rat anim ugly (check how sheep synchronises and do the same)
--DONE: faster rotation speed-- have rat LOOK WHERE THEY'RE GOING (don't drink and drive)
	play with outside players (unity matchmaking)
-- huh yes they do?-- client's camera don't follow them
--DONE-- anim sheep death: plays anim twice on first time (afterwards, only once like they should). Why?
