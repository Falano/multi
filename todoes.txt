todoes multi

to implement:
--DONE-- anim sheep death
	anim sheep death same col as sheep
	when dead follow other players
	custom colors depending on the day (christmas, gay pride, halloween...) (colourblind option)
	custom colours dans le menu
	custom number of colours? hard to level design - except if each map has a number of colours - and they only show if the right number of colours is set; colours sheep < map: areas where they'd rather not go (interesting if those are corridors); colours sheep > map: random change col sucks for player (good? bad?)
	custom key bindings (global or local? Maybe all boring settings are local. They should.)
	(boring options menu in-game)
	custom musics
	sound volume
	custom EVERYTHING
	more lvls
	some tuto or sth
	teeeeeeams! (how many) (divide total players by teams, substract; divide rest total numbers by rest teams, substract; etc. )
	team share lives (both have to be ok with it, and they change col painlessly while doing it)
	max number of players (lobby)
	max time
	deathwave (how often) (et donne une couleur: s'ils sont pas sur cette couleur ils meurent)
	leur demander leur nom (lobby)
	score screen (time of death, colour changes to others, colour changes from others, self colour changes, mice inflicted-colour changes, number of kills?) (faire une classe score qui chope automatiquement les noms des joueurs) 
	different game modes? (no idea which though, except for deathwave/teams/chrono); actually, having preset options: attrition war (lots of life), thunderstorm (little life, frequent deathwaves, teams), chacun pour soi, teams of two, two sides, 
	cooldown?
	make a lvl editor :D
	gérer pos camera so it doesn't fish eye so much

bugs:
--DONE--	client only on second time
	rat anim ugly (check how sheep synchronises and do the same)
--DONE: faster rotation speed-- have rat LOOK WHERE THEY'RE GOING (don't drink and drive)
	play with outside players (unity matchmaking) (lobby)
-- huh yes they do?-- client's camera don't follow them
--DONE-- anim sheep death: plays anim twice on first time (afterwards, only once like they should). Why?
	needs wider lookat radius for attackChangeCOl
	fix mice's lvlSize array
	check if attackChangeCol works as intended
	sometimes sheep death anim only works on localPlayer
