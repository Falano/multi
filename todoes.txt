to implement:
--doing-- anim sheep death
	when dead follow other players

bugs:
	client only on second time
	rat anim ugly (check how sheep synchronises and do the same)
--DONE: faster rotation speed-- have rat LOOK WHERE THEY'RE GOING (don't drink and drive)
	play with outside players (unity matchmaking)
-- huh yes they do?-- client's camera don't follow them
	anim sheep death: plays anim twice on first time (afterwards, only once like they should). Why?
