LAN/internet
always listening for LAN o net game;
if host (both) start broadcasting e stop listening
if guest, stop both e just connect
button "nope" to stop listening one kind (toggles: can become "yeah!")

LAN:
host: start broadcasting and enter the lobby (once the game has started, stop broadcasting)
guest: start listening: button "connect to 192.168.x.xxx?"; if gain host, connexion; else: "pas gain host :("
I could use this to keep unwanteds out. Hm. Being able to barge in spectating would probably be better; but...

net:
host (name)
guest: list of names + search bar
