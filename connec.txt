LAN/internet


LAN:
host: start broadcasting and enter the lobby (once the game has started, stop broadcasting)
guest: start listening: button "connect to 192.168.x.xxx?"; if gain host, connexion; else: "pas gain host :("
I could use this to keep unwanteds out. Hm. Being able to barge in spectating would probably be better; but...
